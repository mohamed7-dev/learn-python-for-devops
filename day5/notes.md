# Notes

## Command Line Arguments
- in python receiving command line arguments is done via `sys` built-in module.
- passing arguments to a python program is preferred when info is not super secure but if we are
dealing with API keys `env variables` would be more secure.

## Env Variables
env variables are those variables exported in a shell and can be accessed in the program via `os` module
