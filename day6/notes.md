# Operators

## Arithmetic Operators
the same ones exist in all programming languages, but the division differs:

- division `/` Divides the left operand by the right operand (results in a floating-point number).
- floor division `//` Divides the left operand by the right operand and rounds down to the nearest whole number.

## Assignment Operators
the same ones exist in all programming languages, but the division differs:

## Logical Operators
python uses keywords `and`, `or`, and `not` not symbols

## Identity Operators
Identity operators in Python are used to compare **the memory locations** of two objects to determine if they are the same object or not. The two identity operators are `is` and `is not`.
