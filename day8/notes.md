# Lists vs Tuples

## Lists
- Mutable
- Slower comparing to tuple since it needs memory re-allocation
- Consumes memory > tuples since it stores info about immutability of their items.

## Tuples
- Immutable -> once created, they can't be modified in any way
- Faster than lists
- Consumes less memory than what lists consume
